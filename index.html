                <p>The Black Pearl is a fictional ship in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In the screenplay,
                    the
                    Black Pearl is easily recognized by her distinctive black hull and sails. Captained by Captain Jack
                    Sparrow, she is said to be "nigh uncatchable". Indeed, in the first three films she either overtakes
                    or
                    flees all other ships, including the Interceptor (regarded as the fastest ship in the Caribbean) and
                    the
                    Flying Dutchman (which is actually faster against the wind). Her speed is partly derived from the
                    large
                    amount of sails she carries, and partly supernatural. She is noted in At World's End as being "the
                    only
                    ship that can outrun the Dutchman."</p>
